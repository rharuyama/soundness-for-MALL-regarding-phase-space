  Features:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Decomposition of Classical Logic 
    \item Realizing constructivity keeping Duality (symmetry) intact 
    \item Resource sensitive (i.e. each hypothesize can be used exactly at once) 
    \item Suitable for expressing parallel computing
  \end{itemize}

    Familiar connectives ``$\wedge$'' and ``$\vee$'' break into weaker four connectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``$\wedge$'' into ``$\otimes$'' and ``$\with$'' 
      \item ``$\vee$''   into ``$\parr$''   and ``$\oplus$'' 
    \end{itemize}

    Another viewpoint:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Multiplicative} are ``$\otimes$'' and ``$\parr$'' 
      \item \textit{Additive} are ``$\with$''   and ``$\oplus$'' 
    \end{itemize}

    System containing only Multiplicative and Additive is called \textit{MALL}

  ``$\multimap$'' is linear version of ``$\Rightarrow$'' \\~\\

  Usual logic :

      \AxiomC{$X$}
      \AxiomC{$X \Rightarrow Y$}
      \BinaryInfC{$Y$ (but $X$ still holds.)}
  \end{prooftree} 

  Linear Logic :
  \begin{prooftree}
      \AxiomC{$X$}
      \AxiomC{$X \multimap Y$}
      \BinaryInfC{$Y$ (and then $X$ disappears!)}

  and

  \begin{prooftree}

    \AxiomC{$Y \with Z \nvdash Y \otimes Z$}
    
  \end{prooftree}

  Meaning : Programs which share the same resouce CANNOT be executed
  at the same time unless copying the resource,
  while we CAN CHOOSE either $Y$ or $Z$. \\
  In fact, copying and deleting of resources are explicit.

  nor

  \begin{prooftree}

  \end{prooftree} 

  Meaning : Either $Y$ or $Z$ holds, but we CANNOT choose neither $Y$ or $Z$.

  First off, what is \textit{semantics}?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item To provide rigorous defnitions that abstract away from implementation
      details
    \item To provide mathematical tools for proving properties of programs
  \end{itemize}
   (Amadio, Curien)\\~\\

  Phase Semantics is a kind of semantics, which is based on the idea of \textit{Tarskian style}: \\

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``A'' means A which is truth value (true or false)
    \item ``A $\wedge$ B'' means ``A'' and ``B''
  \end{itemize}

  and so on.\\

  This seems ovious, however, there is another semantics which is not the case: \textit{Coherent Semantics}, which is BHK style inconsistent semantics. \\

  \textit{Phase Space} is Phase Semantics for MALL.
